# Sudoku
Sudoku is a puzzle in which players insert the numbers one to nine into a grid consisting of nine squares subdivided into a further nine smaller squares in such a way that every number appears once in each horizontal line, vertical line, and square.

This is a python based Sudoku Solver. It eliminates the possible guesses at first and when no progress is made, it brute forces a square and repeats.


## Requirements
Python 3.8 or greater

## Usage
Go into `sudoku_board.txt` and input your board, 9 numbers per line and 9 rows in total. Finally run the program and look at the output.
